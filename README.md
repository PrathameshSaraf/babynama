In this assignment, I used the Flutter framework along with the Stacked architecture to implement the required features. The following packages were used:

- `flutter_lints: ^2.0.0`
- `build_runner`
- `icon_forest: ^1.1.8`
- `stacked: ^3.4.1+1`
- `stacked_services: ^1.3.0`
- `auto_route: ^6.4.0`
- `stacked_generator: ^1.3.3`
- `stacked_hooks: ^0.2.2`
- `easy_widgets: ^0.0.7`
- `logger: ^1.4.0`
- `flutter_screenutil: ^5.9.0`
- `injectable: ^2.3.2`
- `get_storage: ^2.1.1`
- `google_fonts: ^6.1.0`

## How to Run the App

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
2.Install dependencies:

  ``` 
3.Generate necessary files:
